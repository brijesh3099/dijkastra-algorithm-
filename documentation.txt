# Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm - Documentation

## Introduction:

This C program demonstrates Dijkstra's algorithm, a method widely used to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph, especially when all edge weights are non-negative. The program calculates the shortest path from a given source vertex to all other vertices in the graph.

## Implementation Details:

- **Language**: The program is implemented in C.
- **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented using an adjacency matrix.
- **Data Structures**: The program defines a structure `Graph` to store graph-related information.
- **Memory Management**: Dynamic memory allocation is used to create and manage the graph structure.
- **Functionality**: 
    - `createGraph`: Dynamically allocates memory for the graph structure and initializes it.
    - `displayResults`: Prints the shortest distances from the source vertex to all other vertices.
    - `findMinDistance`: Finds the vertex with the minimum distance from the source among the vertices not yet included in the shortest path tree.
    - `computeShortestPath`: Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest paths.
- **Input**: The graph data and the source vertex are hardcoded into the program.
- **Output**: The program displays the shortest distances from the source vertex to all other vertices.

## Workflow:

1. The program initializes the graph structure and populates it with the provided graph data.
2. Dijkstra's algorithm is executed to compute the shortest paths from the source vertex to all other vertices.
3. The computed shortest distances are displayed.

## Example:

For the provided graph data and source vertex, the program outputs the shortest distances from the source vertex to all other vertices.

## Conclusion:

Dijkstra's algorithm is an efficient method for finding shortest paths in graphs. This program provides a practical implementation of the algorithm, showcasing its utility in real-world scenarios.
